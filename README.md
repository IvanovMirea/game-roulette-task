# game-roulette-task
In this task we will try to get more familiar with an API development. We will implement a CS:GO knife roulette. Our service will provide endpoints to get, add, buy knifes and even trying our luck to win one.

## About implementation
The whole app logic is inside a Program.cs class. It use minimal api to configuring endpoints.

## Tasks
1. Implement logic for buying knifes
2. Create a new endpoint which adds a knife
3. Create a new endpoint which will give a random knife

## Testing
For a test purposes we will use `Swagger`. To reach it, we should open 'http://localhost:5000/swagger' and use it UI to test our endpoints.
